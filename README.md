# Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing the projects I completed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. This comprehensive certificate program includes six courses, each with hands-on projects designed to apply the skills learned.

## 1. Foundations of Data Science

In the **Foundations of Data Science** course, I delved into the core principles of data science and their real-world applications. I gained insights into various industries that rely on advanced analytics and understood the critical role of data analysis in decision-making. Additionally, I learned about data privacy and ethics, ensuring confidentiality and integrity in data handling.

### ðŸŸ¡ Project: [Automatidata Project Proposal](./Automatidata-Project-Proposal.pdf)
In this project, I demonstrated an effective data science workflow by creating a comprehensive project proposal. The proposal outlined essential tasks and milestones, utilizing the PACE strategy document to ensure efficient project planning and successful execution.

## 2. Get Started with Python

The **Get Started with Python** course introduced me to essential Python programming fundamentals for data tasks. I covered syntax, semantics, loops, control statements, string manipulation, and data structures.

### ðŸŸ  Project: [Automatidata - Exploring New York City TLC Data](./Automatidata_NYC_TLC)
In this project, I analyzed data from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The goal was to identify key variables, ensure data readiness, and derive actionable insights for data-driven solutions.

## 3. Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights

In this course, I refined the ability to translate data into meaningful insights. I mastered the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process, data structuring, cleaning, and visualization with Tableau, creating impactful visualizations to convey insights effectively.

### ðŸ”´ Project: [New York City TLC EDA - Insights for Taxi Ridership](./NYC_TLC_Data_Exploration_Project)
This project aimed to uncover valuable insights into NYC taxi ridership through EDA and data visualization. I developed a Python notebook with structured data, engaging matplotlib/seaborn visuals, and an inclusive Tableau dashboard to support informed decision-making for NYC TLC.

## 4. The Power of Statistics

In **The Power of Statistics** course, I explored practical statistical analysis techniques to extract valuable insights from datasets. I understood probability distributions for accurate data modeling and conducted hypothesis tests and statistical analyses with Python to uncover hidden patterns and trends.

### ðŸŸ¢ Project: [New York City TLC - Statistical Review and A/B Testing](./NYC_TLC_AB_Testing)
This project focused on predicting taxi cab fares and finding ways to generate more revenue for New York City taxi drivers. It examined the relationship between total fare amount and payment type, using statistical methods to inform business decisions.

## 5. Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships

This course equipped me with skills to investigate relationships within datasets and identify regression model assumptions. I became proficient in linear and logistic regression in Python, learning to evaluate and interpret models to make informed decisions based on statistical evidence.

### ðŸ”µ Project: [New York City TLC - Taxi Fare Prediction](./NYC_Taxi_Fare_Prediction)
In this project, I built a multiple linear regression model to accurately predict taxi fares for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). Using a year's worth of data, I provided valuable insights to enhance data-driven decision-making for both taxi drivers and passengers.

## 6. The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning

This course provided a deep dive into the foundations of machine learning. I learned to prepare data for models, build and evaluate supervised and unsupervised learning models, and gained insights into proper model and metric selection to apply machine learning techniques effectively to real-world datasets.

### ðŸŸ£ Project: [New York City TLC - Generous Tip Predictor](./Generous_Tip_Predictor)
The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that predicts the most generous customersâ€”those who will tip 20% or moreâ€”based on data from the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). Identifying these generous customers aimed to help taxi drivers increase their earnings from tips and improve overall customer service.

## â›³ Capstone: [Salifort Motors Employee Attrition Prediction](./Salifort_Motors)
**Project Goal:** To develop a predictive model to identify employees at risk of leaving Salifort Motors, with the ultimate goal of reducing employee attrition.

Feel free to explore the projects to see the practical application of data analytics skills and techniques I acquired throughout the program.
